        <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
        <p>1. Allow yourself at least 2 hours, but at most 3 hours, undisturbed to complete this mock examination.</p>
        <p>2. Record your answers to all problems on your own scrap paper. Note that the real examination does <em>not</em> allow you to use scrap paper for any purpose.</p>
        <p>3. Significant figures are <em>not</em> required, but recommended, unless otherwise noted.</p>
        <p>4. You are allowed a calculator and your NYS Chemistry reference table.</p><br>
        <p>This mock examination is intended to assess your strong and weak points in your knowledge of chemistry. As such, all problems are "fair game" for the Regents examination, but they may lean more difficult than
        the typical Regents exam. An answer key to all problems, including the free-response problems, is
        provided on the Breakthrough Education Academy website.</p>
