        <p style="font-size:20px;">Breakthrough Education Academy (BEA) was cofounded in late 2023 by Derek Guo and Alex Kim, two high school students from Upstate New York, with the intent to provide students with supplemental education in STEM (<u>S</u>cience, <u>T</u>echnology, <u>E</u>ngineering, <u>M</u>athematics) subjects. Both Derek and Alex understood the importance of STEM education for the next generation of the world's leaders.</p>
        <p style="font-size:20px;">In fact, our Academy Motto stems (pun intended) from that indisputable fact. "Aedificationem crastina duces" roughly translated from Latin is "Building the next generation of leaders." Even if not to many students, Derek and Alex hoped to instill an interest and understanding in STEM in at least students at their own high school.</p>
        <p style="font-size:20px;">Derek and Alex were joined by fellow student Eavan Qin soon after BEA's founding. Despite having to balance high school responsibilities, extracurriculars, and freetime, the trio produced a 50-page professional review book for the NYS Geometry Regents examination, which sold more than 20 copies with overall positive reviews.</p>
        <p style="font-size:20px;">BEA welcomed three additional high schoolers to the team in the summer of 2024, making up the current team. This current team has an ambitious, albeit difficult to achieve, plan for the 2024–25 school year. This plan includes shorter study guides than the previous Geometry Regents review book, mentoring services based on exclusive interviews with successful students at the world's best universities and their own experiences, reach expansion, and more.</p>
